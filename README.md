# CSE 312 - Microprocessors & Assembly Lab

This repo is for the **CSE 312: Microprocessors & Assembly Lab** course at the Department of Computer Science and Engineering, University of Asia Pacific. This repository contains my attempt at making some well documented codes for the lab thatt even help in the theory part of the course. Feel free to use it as a reference.

## Course Description

This course is designed to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of the fundamental concepts of microprocessor and assembly language programming. The course will cover the architecture of microprocessors, instruction set, addressing modes, assembly language programming, interfacing of memory and I/O devices, and microprocessor-based system design. The course will also cover the basic concepts of microcontroller and its programming.
